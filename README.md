Hi, I'm Yixuan Wang from School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

I started my PhD in SJTU at 2024 Fall. Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree in SJTU, majoring in Artificial Intelligence.

I'm now studying in [LUMIA](https://lumia-group.github.io/#/) group under the guidance of [Prof. Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/). My current research interests lie in pretraining methods, hierachical model and efficient LLMs.

I also joined [Shanghai Innovation Institute (SII)](https://github.com/sii-research) in 2024 and have some cooperation there.
