Hi, I'm Yixuan Wang from School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

I started my PhD in SJTU at 2024 Fall. Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree in SJTU, majoring in Artificial Intelligence.

I'm now studying in [LUMIA](https://lumia-group.github.io/#/) group under the guidance of Prof. Zhouhan Lin. My current research interests lie in pretraining methods, languge model training and multi-modal speech recognition.

I also joined Shanghai Innovation Institute (SII) in 2024 and have some cooperation with the students there.
